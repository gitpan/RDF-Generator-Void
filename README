NAME
    RDF::Generator::Void - Generate voiD descriptions based on data in an
    RDF model

VERSION
    Version 0.01_13

    Note that this is an early alpha release. It has pretty limited
    functionality, and there may very significant changes in this module
    coming up really soon.

SYNOPSIS
      use RDF::Generator::Void;
      use RDF::Trine::Model;
      my $mymodel   = RDF::Trine::Model->temporary_model;
      [add some data to $mymodel here]
      my $generator = RDF::Generator::Void->new(inmodel => $mymodel);
      my $voidmodel = $generator->generate;

DESCRIPTION
    This module takes a RDF::Trine::Model object as input to the
    constructor, and based on the data in that model, it creates a new model
    with a voiD description of the data in the model.

METHODS
  new(inmodel => $mymodel, dataset_uri => URI->new($dataset_uri));
  inmodel
    Read-only accessor

  dataset_uri
    Read-only accessor

  generate
    Returns the voiD as an RDF::Trine::Model.
