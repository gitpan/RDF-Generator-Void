NAME
    RDF::Generator::Void - Generate VoID descriptions based on data in an
    RDF model

VERSION
    Version 0.05_1

    Note that this is a beta release. It has the core functionality in place
    to create a basic VoID description and what's there should be working
    well. Nevertheless significant changes in this module may be coming up
    really soon.

SYNOPSIS
      use RDF::Generator::Void;
      use RDF::Trine::Model;
      my $mymodel   = RDF::Trine::Model->temporary_model;
      [add some data to $mymodel here]
      my $generator = RDF::Generator::Void->new(inmodel => $mymodel);
      $generator->urispace('http://example.org');
      $generator->add_endpoints('http://example.org/sparql');
      my $voidmodel = $generator->generate;

DESCRIPTION
    This module takes a RDF::Trine::Model object as input to the
    constructor, and based on the data in that model as well as data
    supplied by the user, it creates a new model with a VoID description of
    the data in the model.

    For a description of VoID, see <http://www.w3.org/TR/void/>.

METHODS
  new(inmodel => $mymodel, dataset_uri => URI->new($dataset_uri));
    The constructor. It can be called with two parameters, namely, "inmodel"
    which is a model we want to describe and "dataset_uri", which is the URI
    we want to use for the description. Users should make sure it is
    possible to get this with HTTP. If this is not possible, you may leave
    this field empty so that a simple URN can be created for you as a
    default.

  "inmodel"
    Read-only accessor for the model used in description creation.

  "dataset_uri"
    Read-only accessor for the URI to the dataset.

  Property Attributes
    The below attributes concern some essential properties in the VoID
    vocabulary. They are mostly arrays, and can be manipulated using array
    methods. Methods starting with "all_" will return an array of unique
    values. Methods starting with "add_" takes a list of values to add, and
    those starting with "has_no_" return a boolean value, false if the array
    is empty.

   "vocabulary", "all_vocabularies", "add_vocabularies", "has_no_vocabularies"
    Methods to manipulate a list of vocabularies used in the dataset. The
    values should be a string that represents the URI of a vocabulary.

   "endpoint", "all_endpoints", "add_endpoints", "has_no_endpoints"
    Methods to manipulate a list of SPARQL endpoints that can be used to
    query the dataset. The values should be a string that represents the URI
    of a SPARQL endpoint.

   "title", "all_titles", "add_titles", "has_no_titles"
    Methods to manipulate the titles of the datasets. The values should be
    RDF::Trine::Node::Literal objects, and should be set with language.
    Typically, you would have a value per language.

   "license", "all_licenses", "add_licenses", "has_no_licenses"
    Methods to manipulate a list of licenses that regulates the use of the
    dataset. The values should be a string that represents the URI of a
    license.

   "urispace", "has_urispace"
    This method is used to set the URI prefix string that will match the
    entities in your dataset. The computation of the number of entities
    depends on this being set. "has_urispace" can be used to check if it is
    set.

  Running this stuff
   "level", "has_level"
    Set the level of detail. 0 doesn't do any statistics or heuristics, 1
    has some statistics for the dataset as a whole. Setting no level will
    give everything.

   "stats", "clear_stats", "has_stats"
    Method to compute a statistical summary for the data in the dataset,
    such as the number of entities, predicates, etc. "clear_stats" will
    clear the statistics and "has_stats" will return true if exists.

   generate( [ $model ] )
    Returns the VoID as an RDF::Trine::Model. You may pass a model with
    statements as argument to this method. This model may then contain
    arbitrary RDF that will be added to the RDF model. If you do not send a
    model, one will be created for you.

TODO
    *   Larger test dataset for more extensive tests.

    *   URI regexps support.

    *   Partitioning based on properties and classes.

    *   Technical features (esp. serializations).

    *   Example resources and root resources.

    *   Data dumps.

    *   Subject classification.

    *   Method to disable heuristics.

    *   More heuristics.

    *   Linkset descriptions.

    *   Set URI space on partitions.

    *   Save the description to files?
